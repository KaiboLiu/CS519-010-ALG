1. Unbounded Knapsack

   You have n items, each with weight w_i and value v_i, and has infinite copies.
   **All numbers are positive integers.**
   What's the best value for a bag of W?

   >>> best(3, [(2, 4), (3, 5)])
   (5, [0, 1])

   the input to the best() function is W and a list of pairs (w_i, v_i).
   this output means to take 0 copies of item 1 and 1 copy of item 2.

   tie-breaking: *reverse* lexicographical: i.e., [1, 0] is better than [0, 1]:
   (i.e., take as much from item 1 as possible, etc.)

   Answers for problem 0:
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
     A: In a recurrence R(i,w_left), which means for item i, we can get better answer by adding 1 copy of item i, or just skip to item i+1, and before we make choice, there is w_left space left. We can not make further decision if w_left <=0, or i==n. Then we can return max{ R(i,w_left-w[i])+v[i], and R(i+1, w_left)}.
        O(2^n) time
        O(2^n) space
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
     A: sort the items by decreasing v[i]/w[i], then put items as many as possible in order.
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
     A: W=11, item=(2,6),(3,8),(5,10)
        greedy is 30,[5,0,0]
        however, the solution is 32,[4,1,0]
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-up one faster?
     A: bottom-up is faster because top-down needs push and pop operations on stack for recursions.
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
     A: bottom-up is faster.
          W=7491 n=840
            bottom-up: 1.28276801109s
            top-down: 1.69787406921s
          W=2715 n=164
            bottom-up: 0.0919718742371s
            top-down: 0.121115207672s
          W=7861 n=334
            bottom-up: 0.550665140152s
            top-down: 0.72564291954s  


   Q: What are the time and space complexities?
   A: O(nW) time.
      O(W) space.

2. [WILL BE GRADED] 
   Bounded Knapsack

   You have n items, each with weight w_i and value v_i, and has c_i copies.
   **All numbers are positive integers.**
   What's the best value for a bag of W?

   Answers for problem 0:
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
     A: In a recurrence R(i,w_left), which means for item i, we can get better answer by adding 0~c_i copy/copies of item i, and before we make choice, there is w_left space left. We can not make further decision if w_left <=0, or i==n. Then we can return max{ R(i,w_left-w[i]*c)+c*v[i]} for any possible c
        O(min(W/w,c)^n) time
        O(min(W/w,c)^n) space
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
     A: sort the items by decreasing v[i]/w[i], then put items as many as possible in order.   
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
     A: W=11, item=(2,6,5),(3,8,2),(5,10,2)
        greedy is 30,[5,0,0]
        however, the solution is 32,[4,1,0]
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-up one faster?
     A: bottom-up is faster because top-down needs push and pop operations on stack for recursions.
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
     A: bottom-up is faster.

   A: O(W*∑{logci'}) time, with binary presentation for each c[i],
      O(W*∑{ci'}) space.
      where ci'=min(ci,lower[w/wi]).

3. Longest (Strictly) Increasing Subsequence
   
   input/output are lower-case strings:
   tiebreaking: arbitrary. any optimal solution is ok.

   Answers for problem 0:
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
     A: In a recurrence (l,i), we have a current index i and a local optimal length l for subsequence ending with s[i]. Then we search for j=i+1~n-1, if s[i]<s[j], then we pass (l+1,j) into recurrence for a larger length.
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
     A: Scan i=0~n-2, then a nested loop starting from j=i+1, pick the fisrt one(let's say j) that s[j] > s[i], then update i,j <- j,j+1 and continue.
        O(n^2).
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
     A: 'azbcd'
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-up one faster?
     A: bottom-up is faster because top-down needs push and pop operations on stack for recursions.
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
     A: bottom-up, because my bottom-up is O(nlogn), while top-down is O(n^2).
