***Please analyze time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.
   [UPDATE] Also explain the algorithm of each question you solved.

1. Given an RNA sequence, such as ACAGU, we can predict its secondary structure 
   by tagging each nucleotide as (, ., or ). Each matching pair of () must be 
   AU, GC, or GU (or their mirror symmetries: UA, GC, UG). 
   We also assume pairs can _not_ cross each other. 
   The following are valid structures for ACAGU:

   ACAGU
   .....
   ...()
   ..(.)
   .(.).
   (...)
   ((.))    

   We want to find the structure with the maximum number of matching pairs. 
   In the above example, the last structure is optimal (2 pairs). 

   >>> best("ACAGU")
   (2, '((.))')

   [UPDATE] Tie-breaking: arbitrary is fine. Don't worry as long as your structure
   is one of the correct best structures.

   [UPDATE] some other cases:

UUCAGGA
(3, '(((.)))')
GUUAGAGUCU
(4, '(.()((.)))')
GCACG
(2, '().()')
AUAACCUUAUAGGGCUCUG
(8, '.(((..)()()((()))))')
UUGGACUUGAGAAAAG
(5, '((...((()))...))')
UCAAUGGGUAGUAAAU
(6, '(((.)))((..(.)))')
UUUGGCACUUUCAGA
(6, '(((((.(..))))))')
ACACACCUUGUCCGUGAA
(6, '.((.(..)))(.()(.))')   
GAUGCCGUGUAGUCCAAAGACUUCACCGUUGG
(14, '.()()(()(()())(((.((.)(.))()))))')
CGCGAAUAAAAAGGCACUGUU
(8, '()()((((....(().)))))')
ACGGCCAGUAAAGGUCAUAUACGCGGAAUGACAGGUCUAUCUAC
(19, '.()(((.)(..))(((.()()(())))(((.)((())))))())')
UGGGUGAGUCGCACACUCUGCGUACUCUUUCCGUAAUU
(15, '.((()((((.()).(.)))(()())).((...()))))')
AUACGUCGGGGACAAGAAUUACGG
(8, '.(.(((()((..(..)..))))))')
AGGCAUCAAACCCUGCAUGGGAGCACCGCCACUGGCGAUUUUGGUA
(20, '.(()())...((((()()))((()(.()(((.)))()())))))()')
CGAGGUGGCACUGACCAAACACCACCGAAAC
(9, '.(.((((().)((.)..))).)...()...)')
CGCCGUCCGGGCGCGCCUUUUACGUAGAUUU
(12, '.(..(...((((())))(((.(())))))))')
CAUCGGGGUCUGAGAUGGCCAUGAAGGGCACGUACUGUUU
(18, '(()())(((((.)))()(((())(.(.().()()))))))')
AACCGCUGUGUCAAGCCCAUCCUGCCUUGUU
(11, '(((.(..(.((.)((...().))()))))))')

2. Total number of all possible structures

   >>> total("ACAGU")
   6

3. k-best structures: output the 1-best, 2nd-best, ... kth-best structures.

   >>> kbest("ACAGU", 3)
   [(2, '((.))'), (1, '(...)'), (1, '.(.).')]
   
   The list must be sorted. 
   [UPDATE] Arbitray tie-breaking is fine.

   In case the input k is bigger than the number of possible structures, output all.

   Sanity check: kbest(s, 1)[0][0] == best(s)[0] for each RNA sequence s.

All three functions should be in one file: rna.py.
