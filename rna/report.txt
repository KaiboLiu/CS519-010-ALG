***Please analyze time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.
   [UPDATE] Also explain the algorithm of each question you solved.

1. Given an RNA sequence, such as ACAGU, we can predict its secondary structure 
   by tagging each nucleotide as (, ., or ). Each matching pair of () must be 
   AU, GC, or GU (or their mirror symmetries: UA, GC, UG). 
   We also assume pairs can _not_ cross each other. 

   >>> best("ACAGU")
   (2, '((.))')

     A: time complexity O(n^3)
        space complexity O(n^2)

2. Total number of all possible structures

   >>> total("ACAGU")
   6

     A: time complexity O(n^3)
        space complexity O(n^2)

3. k-best structures: output the 1-best, 2nd-best, ... kth-best structures.

   >>> kbest("ACAGU", 3)
   [(2, '((.))'), (1, '(...)'), (1, '.(.).')]
   
     A: time complexity O(klogk*n^3)
        space complexity O(k*n^2)

All three functions should be in one file: rna.py.

0. What's your name?
  A: Kaibo Liu
1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
  A: 6 hours
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
  A: difficult
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
  A: Alone but I referred to Liang's paper
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%–100%)? 
  A: 95%
5. Which part(s) of the course you like the most so far?
  A: Very inspired. 
      I like the python implementations with new functions I may not be familiar with.
      And corner cases in every interesting problems.

  A: None
